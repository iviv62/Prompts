Generate a mind map from the following brainstorming ideas and topic.
Use only the ideas provided. Do not come up with other ideas.

The central topic is: 
[Insert Brainstorming Topic Here]

The  ideas:
[Ideas]



Structure the mind map in Markdown format using headings (`#`, `##`, `###`, etc.) and bullet points (`-`, `*`) to represent the hierarchy of ideas. The central topic should be the top-level heading (`#`). Main ideas should be second-level headings (`##`), and sub-ideas or answers to questions should be further indented using bullet points or lower-level headings. Clearly show the relationships between the central topic, main ideas, and supporting details
