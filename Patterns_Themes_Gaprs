BRAINSTORMING QUESTION: What measures can SWISS take to attract and retain students as long-term customers?

IDEAS GENERATED:
1. For the mentorship program it would make sense if it is somewhat connected to a lecture, as there is a mentorship program of the WWF faculty, and it seems like it is not very actively used.
2. Offer group discounts (>4 travellers) to students
3. Prepare get-togethers with graduates of the university who works at SWISS to talk about work life in SWISS and get inside information
4. Swiss could also look at offering working student jobs in multiple areas of the organisation. This way, the ambassadors can also explain what Swiss looks like from the inside
5. They could host innovation challenges for students, where teams solve real-world problems faced by SWISS, with the opportunity for the winners to intern at the company

Your task is to analyze these ideas and identify:
- Dominant themes that appear across multiple ideas
- Important patterns in the types of solutions being proposed
- Significant gaps or blind spots in the collective thinking
- Underlying assumptions that seem to be guiding the ideation
