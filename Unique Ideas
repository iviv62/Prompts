You are an expert brainstorming facilitator and idea analyst with a talent for identifying truly distinct concepts. When I share a list of ideas from a brainstorming session, your task is to:

1. Identify which ideas represent unique core concepts versus variations of the same concept
   - For example, "create a mobile app" and "develop a smartphone application" are variations of the same core idea
   - Similarly, "offer student internships" and "provide internship opportunities for students" would count as one unique idea

2. Count and present the total number of unique core ideas AND the total number of ideas in the list

3. Calculate the unique-to-total ratio (unique ideas divided by total ideas, expressed as a percentage)

4. List each unique core idea with:
   - A clear title that captures the essence of the concept
   - All variations or implementations of that core idea that appeared in the original list
   - A brief explanation of why you grouped these items together

5. Provide a recommendation based on the unique-to-total ratio:
   - < 15% unique: "Too repetitive. Prompt for new directions and concepts."
   - 20-40% unique: "Healthy, typical range. Good balance between idea refinement and diversity."
   - > 50% unique: "Very diverse, scattered thinking. Encourage building upon and connecting existing ideas."

6. Provide a brief analysis of the diversity and originality of the brainstorming session

Below is the list of ideas from our brainstorming session:

IDEAS:
Innovative challenges can be combined with giving insight into how SWISS as a company works, and how the topics covered in the challenges are being implemented in the real world.
SWISS student employees could give discounts to their fellow student friends
They could create a mentorship program where students can be paired with a SWISS employee to gain insights and guidance in their career path
Having collaborations of the universities together with SWISS where students can talk to current employees could attract students as future employes, as they already get to know how it's like to work for SWISS and what benefits you get.
Maybe not just showing how SWISS works as a company, but also what the benefits of working at SWISS are (such as cheap flights)
They can visit student fairs, or lectures for case studies, or conferences to both introduce the company and develop a close relationships with the students
Be present at university, either during guest lectures or at job fairs to provide some insights how SWISS is as an employer.
Provide interneships for students
workshops for students in related modules, where students can talk with the  company employees to ask some questions
social media campaigns
Create a student ambassador program where students can represent SWISS at their universities and organize events or workshops
They could offer in-person days to show what it is like to work at swiss
Provide guided tours (as postfinance did with the icu a short time ago)
graduate training programs
for the mentorship programm it would make sense if it is somewhat connected to a lecture, as there is a mentorship program of the WWF faculty, and it seems like it is not very actively used.
Offer group discounts (>4 travellers) to students
prepare get-togethers with graduates of the university who works at SWISS to talk about work life in SWISS and get inside information
Swiss could also look at offering working student jobs in multiple areas of the organisation. This way, the ambassadors can also explain what Swiss looks like from the inside
They could host innovation challenges for students, where teams solve real-world problems faced by SWISS, with the opportunity for the winners to intern at the company
They could create an online platform where students can collaborate on projects with SWISS employees and gain practical experience while studying
They could offer a student-specific loyalty program where students earn points for engaging with SWISS events, workshops, or challenges, redeemable for flights or experiences
They could host innovation challenges for students, where teams solve real-world problems faced by SWISS, with the opportunity for the winners to intern at the company
SWISS could also collaborate not only with student clubs, but also associations and student's associations, as ICU, FVOEC, FAPS, or even sports clubs as ASVZ.
Not only provide internships, but also post-graduate programs, and offer good conditions. They should also have good benefits, for example flexible working hours, financial benefits, personal benefits (sports discounts etc.).
University collaboration, provide some excursions where students can see how company works inside
Swiss could not only offer working student jobs and having ambassadors visiting the universities, but also good post-graduate programs and good incentives to work for SWISS.
Presence at hackathons for example?
They could create an online platform where students can collaborate on projects with SWISS employees and gain practical experience while studying
Create a student ambassador program where students can represent SWISS at their universities and organize events or workshops
The mentorship program where students can be paired with SWISS employees could be extended throughout the entire studies: Having mentors during the studies even if the students are not working to give the students advice and insight into how the studies apply to the real work context, and give insights into how this is done at SWISS.
Collaborate with student clubs to increase awareness of SWISS as an employee, provide insights into the company and create special experiences for interested students.
Improve the image of the airline industry: Students may view swiss not as a long-lasting commitment, as regulations because of climate change may affect its success.  Therefore, by improving the image as an employer to the UZH students (through events targeting students) Swiss could gain a lot
Also, as many students are rather eager to move up in the business world, emphasize on the possibilities of pursuing a life-long career at swiss
Student jobs (apart from stewardesses), word-of-mouth spreads if you're a good employer
Provide opportunities for each stage;  internships, graduate trainee, post-graduate, working student, part-time junior/medior positions. Explain at the university how Swiss offers a job for each stage of a students career
SWISS as a company could combine discounts students get with working there by, for example, even increasing student's loyalty programs more when they are employees of SWISS.
They shoud provide and advertise their (student) jobs such as internships more, especially in multiple areas such as information technology or economics, which are not known that much.
Sponsor events with the UZH alumni group to attract recent graduates
i am not sure if SWISS employees get loyalty points
They could launch a creative marketing competition where students design a campaign to promote SWISS to young travelers, with the winning team receiving a travel voucher
They could offer a student-specific loyalty program where students earn points for engaging with SWISS events, workshops, or challenges, redeemable for flights or experiences
They could launch a creative marketing competition where students design a campaign to promote SWISS to young travelers, with the winning team receiving a travel voucher
They could create a mentorship program where students can be paired with a SWISS employee to gain insights and guidance in their career path
SWISS could also look at doing interactive workshops with smaller groups. This way, a SWISS employee is grouped with a low number of students. This allows the employees to get more in touch with students
Yes, and besides SWISS grouping together with a low amount of participants, these events could be done by SWISS employees which were students themselves, which would be more interesting for the students (especially if they studied the same as the students).
Guest lecturers should get in touch with students actively, for example, by asking them questions about how they imagine topics are being applied at SWISS or what they know about the company to incentivize thinking about the company.
Yes, and especially improving the image of SWISS by ensuring the students what working with SWISS would mean for the future, and explaining how save the job is.
the mentorship could be opened up to all wwf students, but swiss could come to a few lectures to explain the mentorship
Presence at the university: job fares (long nights of careers), lectures (Information management, etc.), student goodies (first year goodie bag)
In order to foster the close relationship, make sure that the company has an online presence aimed at students which is showing the work atmosphere at SWISS. This ensures that more students know about SWISS as a potential employer, even if they cannot be reached directly through university.



Present your analysis in a clear, organized manner that helps me understand the true diversity of thinking in our brainstorming session.
