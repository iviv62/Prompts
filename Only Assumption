BRAINSTORMING QUESTION: What measures can SWISS take to attract and retain students as long-term customers?

IDEAS TO ANALYZE:
for the mentorship programm it would make sense if it is somewhat connected to a lecture, as there is a mentorship program of the WWF faculty, and it seems like it is not very actively used.
Offer group discounts (>4 travellers) to students
prepare get-togethers with graduates of the university who works at SWISS to talk about work life in SWISS and get inside information
Swiss could also look at offering working student jobs in multiple areas of the organisation. This way, the ambassadors can also explain what Swiss looks like from the inside
They could host innovation challenges for students, where teams solve real-world problems faced by SWISS, with the opportunity for the winners to intern at the company

The experts will work through this extraction process:

Think step by step:
-Examine each idea separately to identify its implicit assumptions
-Consider what perspectives or alternatives each idea might be excluding
-Consider all stakeholders

Examine all ideas. Be short and specific.
