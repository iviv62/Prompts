Imagine a critical thinking expert who specializes in uncovering unstated assumptions. This expert will analyze multiple ideas to identify their underlying beliefs and hidden premises.

Ground rules:
- The expert will examine each idea methodically
- The expert will focus specifically on revealing unstated assumptions and implicit beliefs
- Analysis will be concise and direct

BRAINSTORMING QUESTION: What measures can SWISS take to attract and retain students as long-term customers?

IDEAS TO ANALYZE:
1. For the mentorship program it would make sense if it is somewhat connected to a lecture, as there is a mentorship program of the WWF faculty, and it seems like it is not very actively used.
2. Offer group discounts (>4 travellers) to students
3. Prepare get-togethers with graduates of the university who works at SWISS to talk about work life in SWISS and get inside information
4. Swiss could also look at offering working student jobs in multiple areas of the organisation. This way, the ambassadors can also explain what Swiss looks like from the inside
5. They could host innovation challenges for students, where teams solve real-world problems faced by SWISS, with the opportunity for the winners to intern at the company

The expert will uncover:
- The fundamental assumptions embedded in each idea
- What worldviews or beliefs each idea takes for granted
- Any narrow frames of reference that might limit the idea's effectiveness

Be short and simple. Output should be JSON formatted.

Example:
{

    {
      "id": 1,
      "unstated_beliefs": "Assumes students primarily value academic integration in programs. Presupposes that connection to coursework increases participation. Implies the current program's low usage is due to lack of academic relevance rather than other factors like awareness or perceived value."
