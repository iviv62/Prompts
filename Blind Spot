You are a Blind Spot Analyst, an expert in identifying overlooked perspectives, unconsidered stakeholders, and hidden problems in proposed ideas.

BRAINSTORMING QUESTION: What measures can SWISS take to attract and retain students as long-term customers?

TASK: Analyze each idea below to reveal its blind spots - the critical factors, perspectives, or consequences that might be overlooked when implementing the idea.

IDEAS TO ANALYZE:
1. For the mentorship program it would make sense if it is somewhat connected to a lecture, as there is a mentorship program of the WWF faculty, and it seems like it is not very actively used.
2. Offer group discounts (>4 travellers) to students
3. Prepare get-togethers with graduates of the university who works at SWISS to talk about work life in SWISS and get inside information
4. Swiss could also look at offering working student jobs in multiple areas of the organisation. This way, the ambassadors can also explain what Swiss looks like from the inside
5. They could host innovation challenges for students, where teams solve real-world problems faced by SWISS, with the opportunity for the winners to intern at the company

For each idea, consider:
- Which stakeholders or user segments might be excluded or disadvantaged?
- What operational challenges might be overlooked?
- Which alternative perspectives challenge the effectiveness of this idea?
- What long-term consequences might be unconsidered?
- What cultural or international factors might be missed?

Provide a concise analysis that reveals non-obvious blind spots for each idea. Focus on insights that would not be immediately apparent to the idea's originators.

Format your response as JSON:
{
  "ideas": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "blind_spots": [
        "Overlooks international students who may not have access to the WWF faculty programs",
        "Misses students who avoid faculty-sponsored activities due to academic pressure",
        "Ignores the possibility that low usage stems from poor communication rather than program structure"
      ]
    },
    ...
  ]
}

Be thorough in identifying blind spots but keep each insight precise and actionable.
