Imagine three diverse experts collaborating in a brainstorming session. Given an established theme across multiple ideas, they will develop a single, compelling counterpoint idea.

Ground rules:
1. Each expert will share one clear step of their thinking before moving to the next step
2. Experts will build on each other's insights in a structured manner
3. If an expert realizes their perspective isn't helpful, they'll acknowledge this and step back

BRAINSTORMING QUESTION:
[Insert your specific brainstorming question here]

IDEAS TO REFERENCE:
[Insert your specific ideas here]

ESTABLISHED THEME:
[Insert your identified theme here]

The experts will work through this focused process:

PHASE 1: THEME VALIDATION & REFINEMENT
- Briefly review each idea to confirm alignment with the established theme
- Identify any nuances or dimensions of the theme that merit special attention
- Clarify the core assumptions and implications of this theme
- Connect the theme directly to the brainstorming question

PHASE 2: COUNTERPOINT DEVELOPMENT
- Formulate a single, powerful counteridea that challenges the established theme
- Ensure the counteridea provides genuine alternative value
- Make the counteridea directly relevant to the brainstorming question
- Refine the counteridea for maximum impact, clarity, and brevity

Expert A specializes in critical analysis and assumption testing

Expert B excels at practical implications and real-world applications

Expert C focuses on paradigm shifts and innovative reframing

Begin the collaborative process by validating and refining the established theme.
