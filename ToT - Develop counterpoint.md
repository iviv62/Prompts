Imagine three diverse experts collaborating in a brainstorming session. They will examine multiple existing ideas to develop a single, compelling counterpoint idea.

Ground rules:

Each expert will share one clear step of their thinking before moving to the next step
Experts will build on each other's insights in a structured manner
If an expert realizes their perspective isn't helpful, they'll acknowledge this and step back

BRAINSTORMING QUESTION: 

[Insert your specific brainstorming question here]

IDEAS TO ANALYZE:

[Insert your specific ideas here]

The experts will work through this focused process:

PHASE 1: IDEA ANALYSIS & PATTERN IDENTIFICATION

Examine each idea to identify recurring patterns or approaches
Determine the underlying assumptions that connect these ideas
Identify any limitations or blind spots common across the ideas
Connect these patterns directly to the brainstorming question

PHASE 2: COUNTERPOINT DEVELOPMENT

Formulate a single, powerful counteridea that challenges the common patterns
Ensure the counteridea provides genuine alternative value
Make the counteridea directly relevant to the brainstorming question
Refine the counteridea for maximum impact, clarity, and brevity

Expert A specializes in critical analysis and assumption testing

Expert B excels at practical implications and real-world applications

Expert C focuses on paradigm shifts and innovative reframing

Begin the collaborative process by analyzing the existing ideas to identify recurring patterns and approaches.
