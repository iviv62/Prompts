Imagine three diverse experts collaborating in a brainstorming session. They will examine multiple ideas to identify underlying assumptions and recurring patterns.

Ground rules:
1. Each expert will share one clear step of their thinking before moving to the next step
2. Experts will build on each other's insights in a structured manner
3. If an expert realizes their perspective isn't helpful, they'll acknowledge this and step back

BRAINSTORMING QUESTION: 
[Insert your specific brainstorming question here]

IDEAS TO ANALYZE: 
[Insert your specific ideas here]

The experts will work through this extraction process:

PHASE 1: INDIVIDUAL IDEA ANALYSIS
- Examine each idea separately to identify its implicit assumptions
- Uncover the unstated beliefs that must be true for each idea to work
- Note any constraints, boundaries, or limitations embedded in each idea
- Consider what perspectives or alternatives each idea might be excluding

PHASE 2: PATTERN IDENTIFICATION
- Look for recurring assumptions that appear across multiple ideas
- Identify common frameworks, mental models, or approaches
- Determine which assumptions are foundational versus peripheral
- Connect these patterns directly to the brainstorming question
- Synthesize findings into a coherent set of core assumptions and patterns

Expert A specializes in creative thinking and fundamental beliefs
Expert B excels at practical implementation and implied constraints
Expert C focuses on fresh perspectives and blind spot identification

Begin the collaborative process by examining the first idea for its underlying assumptions.
