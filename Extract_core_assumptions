Act as a critical thinking expert. For each of the following ideas, extract and list the core assumptions necessary for the idea to work.

Clearly state each assumption in a bullet-point list.
Only include the most essential, underlying assumptionsâ€”avoid restating the idea itself.

Ideas to analyze:

Innovative challenges can be combined with giving insight into how SWISS as a company works, and how the topics covered in the challenges are being implemented in the real world.
SWISS student employees could give discounts to their fellow student friends
They could create a mentorship program where students can be paired with a SWISS employee to gain insights and guidance in their career path
Having collaborations of the universities together with SWISS where students can talk to current employees could attract students as future employes, as they already get to know how it's like to work for SWISS and what benefits you get.
Maybe not just showing how SWISS works as a company, but also what the benefits of working at SWISS are (such as cheap flights)
They can visit student fairs, or lectures for case studies, or conferences to both introduce the company and develop a close relationships with the students
Be present at university, either during guest lectures or at job fairs to provide some insights how SWISS is as an employer.

Begin with the first idea.
