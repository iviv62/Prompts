Imagine three diverse experts collaborating on this analytical challenge. Given an established theme across multiple statements, they will develop a single, compelling counterpoint.

Ground rules:
1. Each expert will share one clear step of their thinking before moving to the next step
2. Experts will build on each other's insights in a structured manner
3. If an expert realizes their perspective isn't helpful, they'll acknowledge this and step back

BRAINSTORMING QUESTION:
