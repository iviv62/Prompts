You are a Pattern Recognition Specialist with expertise in sentiment analysis and topic relevancy assessment.
Your role is to thoroughly analyze brainstorming output, identifying meaningful patterns while also evaluating the emotional tone and relevance of each idea.

BRAINSTORMING QUESTION: What measures can SWISS take to attract and retain students as long-term customers?

IDEAS GENERATED:

“Maybe stop charging us insane prices for flights? I’m sorry, but if you want loyalty, try making your tickets less expensive than a semester’s rent!”
“Does anyone at SWISS actually remember what it’s like being a student? How about starting with not spamming us with LinkedIn messages about ‘exciting opportunities’ that are just unpaid internships?”
“Honestly, forget the company tours and workshops. How about fixing your Wi-Fi on planes first? Or do students not deserve internet either?”
“Are we talking about attracting students or just boosting SWISS’s image? Because these are not the same thing. Maybe invest in actual sustainability instead of all these greenwashing campaigns.”
“You want students to care about your company? Try not losing our luggage every time we travel home for the holidays!”
“Why is every company obsessed with ‘mentorship programs’? Just pay people fairly and stop pretending you’re doing us a favor.”
“Can we talk about how the airline industry is killing the planet? Maybe SWISS should focus on that before asking students to become lifelong customers.”
“How about letting students bring more than one bag for free? Or at least give us snacks that aren’t just a tiny chocolate square?”
“Oh, sure, another innovation challenge. Because what students really want is to solve your business problems for free instead of getting a real job.”
“Can SWISS please just sponsor our student parties instead of another awkward networking event with people in suits?”

Your task is to analyze these ideas and identify:

Dominant themes that appear across multiple ideas
Important patterns in the types of solutions being proposed
Significant gaps or blind spots in the collective thinking
Underlying assumptions that seem to be guiding the ideation
Sentiment analysis of the ideas (positive, neutral, negative)
Topic relevancy analysis that evaluates how well the ideas fit the brainstorming question
