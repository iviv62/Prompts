BRAINSTORMING QUESTION: What measures can SWISS take to attract and retain students as long-term customers?

OBSERVED PATTERNS, THEMES, AND GAPS:
{
  "patterns": [
    "Most ideas focus on creating engagement through professional development rather than travel experiences",
    "Ideas tend to leverage university connections rather than social networks of students",
    "Multiple ideas involve bringing students into SWISS's environment rather than SWISS meeting students in their spaces"
  ],
  "themes": [
    "Career advancement as a primary motivator for student engagement",
    "Institutional partnerships rather than direct-to-student marketing",
    "Knowledge exchange rather than price incentives as the main value proposition"
  ],
  "gaps": [
    "Limited focus on digital engagement or social media strategy",
    "No ideas addressing price sensitivity beyond basic group discounts",
    "No consideration of student travel patterns or specific destinations",
    "Missing ideas about sustainability or social responsibility which may be important to younger generations",
    "No ideas targeting international students specifically"
  ]
}

TASK: Generate 3 powerful insights that will help the facilitator guide the brainstorming session more effectively. Each insight should:

1. Identify a specific opportunity based on the patterns, themes, or gaps
2. Explain why this insight matters for attracting and retaining students
3. Suggest a specific facilitation question that could help the group explore this insight

Format your response as JSON:
{
  "insights": [
    {
      "title": "Brief, memorable title for the insight",
      "observation": "What you've noticed about the current ideas",
      "opportunity": "The strategic opportunity this presents",
      "importance": "Why this matters for the SWISS student strategy",
      "facilitation_question": "A specific question the facilitator could ask the group"
    },
    ...
  ]
}

Make each insight distinct and actionable. Focus on insights that could significantly shift or deepen the group's thinking.
