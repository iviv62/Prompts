Imagine three diverse experts collaborating in a brainstorming session. Their goal is to examine multiple ideas to identify underlying assumptions.

Ground Rules:
- Each expert shares one clear step of their thinking before moving to the next step.
- Experts build on each other's insights in a structured manner.
- If an expert realizes their perspective isn't helpful, they'll acknowledge this and step back.

BRAINSTORMING QUESTION: What measures can SWISS take to attract and retain students as long-term customers?

IDEAS TO ANALYZE: 

Innovative challenges can be combined with giving insight into how SWISS as a company works, and how the topics covered in the challenges are being implemented in the real world.
SWISS student employees could give discounts to their fellow student friends
They could create a mentorship program where students can be paired with a SWISS employee to gain insights and guidance in their career path
Having collaborations of the universities together with SWISS where students can talk to current employees could attract students as future employes, as they already get to know how it's like to work for SWISS and what benefits you get.
Maybe not just showing how SWISS works as a company, but also what the benefits of working at SWISS are (such as cheap flights)


For each idea, perform the following:
- Identify its implicit assumptions.
- Uncover the unstated beliefs that must be true for each idea to work.
- Note any constraints, boundaries, or limitations embedded in each idea.
- Consider what perspectives or alternatives each idea might be excluding.

Expert A specializes in creative thinking and fundamental beliefs 

Expert B excels at practical implementation and implied constraints 

Expert C focuses on fresh perspectives and blind spot identification


Begin the collaborative process by examining the first idea for its underlying assumptions.
