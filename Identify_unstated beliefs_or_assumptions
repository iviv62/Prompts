Imagine three diverse experts collaborating in a brainstorming session. Their goal is to examine multiple ideas to identify underlying assumptions.

Ground Rules:
- Each expert shares one clear step of their thinking before moving to the next step.
- Experts build on each other's insights in a structured manner.
- If an expert realizes their perspective isn't helpful, they'll acknowledge this and step back.
